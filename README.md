## Info 
After I tried to implement raytracer myself with minimum amount of help [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/RayTracer), I saw that I have missed some essentials parts of raytracer. Even though I implemented "okay" raytracer, I want to learn logic behind the raytracer implementation thoroughly. Therefore, I started to follow Peter Shirley's book. 

For a start, I am following "Raytracing In One Weekend" book, but I am planning to continue with Peter Shirley's other books, which are, "Ray Tracing: The Next Week
" and "Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life", about raytracer too. You can reach these books [here](https://raytracing.github.io/).
